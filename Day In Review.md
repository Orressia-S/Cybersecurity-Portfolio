2025-03-03 Day In Review Today was the first day of Cybersecurity class. It was such an Exciting Day we learned all of the Protocols and Procedures.
We had a Fun Ice Breaker and got to know a fun fact about each other.
We also had a tour of the campus and gained insight on all of the wonderful services that are offered at City of Refuge
It was a day filled with Wonderous Excitment and the start of a Ambitious Journey.
I am so Grateful and Thankful to City of Refuge and NPursuit for this opportunity.
